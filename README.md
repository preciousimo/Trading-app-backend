# Trading App Backend
This is the backend of a trading application, built with Django and PostgreSQL. It provides RESTful APIs to enable users to perform trading transactions and retrieve market data.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you can run this application, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:
* Python (version 3.6 or higher)
* PostgreSQL

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/preciousimo/Trading-app-backend.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
cd Trading-app-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project, and add the following environment variables::
```
DB_HOST=<database-host>
DB_NAME=<database-name>

DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>
```
Replace database-host, database-name, database-user, and database-password with your own values.
